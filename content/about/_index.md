The Silver Age is a group of movers and shakers and candlestickmakers.
We are the pastry chefs of the future, and you never can tell what we'll whip up next.

## Our Mission

Things are getting bad, and we don't know what to do about it.
We don't think anybody does!
Your remaining options are to wait or to go.
Which one will it be?

## Our Home

Our headquarters, or the <q>Headquarters</q> as we like to call it, is just as fun as a ball pit.
Come swing on by at our next event, come give us a chat!
We mean it!
You will find the friendliest, most inviting rooms and zaniest interior decor this side of the Schuylkill river at the Silver Age Headquarters.
