The Silver Age is a group of movers and shakers and candlestickmakers.
We are the pastry chefs of the future, and you never can tell what we'll whip up next.

## Our Mission

Things are getting pretty bad, and we don't know what to do about it.
We don't think anybody does!
But one thing is for sure: no existing structure or institution can help.
The problem is deeper than that.
So we're doing everything we can to outrun it, and bringing our friends and family with us.
The sun's going down, and we're headed West.

## Our Home

Our headquarters, or the <q>Headquarters</q> as we like to call it, is just as fun as a ball pit.
Come swing on by at our next event, come give us a chat!
We mean it!
You will find the friendliest, most inviting rooms and zaniest interior decor this side of the Schuylkill river at the Silver Age Headquarters.
