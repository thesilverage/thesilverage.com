<blockquote>Without hope. Without witness. Without reward.</blockquote>

A mission to answer a spaceship's distress call goes awry when Bill, one of the Doctor's companions, is shot, then abducted.
With one end of the massive spaceship caught by a black hole, time passes at wildly different rates: in the handful of seconds the Doctor expends planning a rescue at the bridge, Bill spends months in captivity at the base of the ship as dangerous forces amass around her.
When the Doctor finally reaches the base and tries to save her, he finds the base of the ship turned into a factory of cybermen hellbent upon killing or converting every person aboard the ship.
For the Doctor, his companions, and the people they're trying to save, the farther they run, the more time the cybermen have to plan, amass, and advance, and the less time they have to mount a last stand.
