Come show off your culture, come share your upbringing and interests with others in the form of a representative song of great significance.
You only get one, so make it good.
Your pick of song will be made a part of the Big Ol' Culture Ensemble poured into our ears over the course of the evening.
We will laugh, we will enjoy, we will psychoanalyze the group through sound alone.
[Submit](https://forms.gle/A1EmuS5Qu5Ng9q9W7) your best song pick to us before the event and prepare to have your identity reduced to your taste in music.
