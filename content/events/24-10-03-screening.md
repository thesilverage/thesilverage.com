*Brazil* (1985) tells the story of Sam, a low-ranking official trapped in the cogs of a monstrously bureaucratic society, as he seeks to make right a wrongful arrest.
After meeting a woman he had imagined in a dream, they try to escape, and Sam is forced to surrender not only the possibility of freedom, but even his dreams of it.
Between heating duct repair workers forced to work in secret outside of official channels and people being callously executed due to clerical errors, Brazil paints a funny and hauntingly familiar picture.
