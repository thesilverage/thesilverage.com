<blockquote>Well, whoever they are, and whatever they've come to do, it's just become a suicide mission.</blockquote>

*The Expanse*, set several hundred years in the future, follows the remnants of the crew of an ice hauler after their ship is inexplicably nuked.
Holden, the former XO, and the rest of the crew are put into a desperate struggle for survival.

<q>CQB</q> tells the story of increasing turmoil in the solar system.
In it, Holden and his crew are prisoners aboard the powerful Martian battleship *Donnager*, captained by the experienced Teresa Yao.
As mysterious plots unravel, an unidentified track trailing the Donnager reveals itself to be a fleet of stealth ships.
Suddenly, the battleship is thrust into close-quarters battle, outnumbered six-to-one by strange, technologically advanced warships.
As the situation deteriorates, Holden and Yao are faced with decisions that will test their character and shape the future of a solar system on the brink of war.
