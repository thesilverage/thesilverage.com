Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, released on March 25th, 2025, has crossed an important and concerning threshold on one of The Silver Age's internal LLM benchmarks.
We will meet to discuss the benchmark, the threshold crossed, its significance, what may be coming next, and what (if any) action we should take to mitigate associated risks.
DM us on Instagram or text 484-800-2275 for the address.
