Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, released on March 25th, 2025, crossed an important and concerning threshold on one of The Silver Age's internal LLM benchmarks.
In the months since, progress has continued at an alarming rate, with Grok 4 currently topping the leaderboard above our estimate of an average person's performance.
We will meet to discuss forecasts of future progress and associated risks, including psychosis, human disempowerment, mass unemployment, ASI takeover, and accelerated social decay.
